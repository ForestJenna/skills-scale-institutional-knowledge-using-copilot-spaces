OctoAcme runs projects with a lightweight, outcome-driven lifecycle that moves work from initiation through planning, execution, release, and continuous improvement. Projects start with a Project One-pager to capture the problem, objective, success metrics, stakeholders, and a high-level timeline. Planning turns approved initiatives into a prioritized, estimated backlog with clear acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done. Core artifacts maintained in the repo include the one-pager/project charter, release plan and milestones, sprint backlogs, a risk register, and retrospective notes — all used as the single source of truth for status and decisions.

Workflows emphasize small, testable increments and clear handoffs. Teams use a project board with columns such as Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done, and follow a pull request process that encourages small PRs, linked issues, acceptance criteria, CI checks, and at least one approval before merge. Planning activities include kickoff meetings, backlog refinement, and dependency identification; risks and cross-team dependencies are captured in the risk register and escalated through defined paths. Deployment follows a checklist-driven release process (staging smoke tests, automated pipelines where possible, rollback plans) and uses release notes and post-deploy verifications to close the loop.

Roles and responsibilities are well-defined so ownership is clear: Product Managers set the vision, success metrics, and prioritize the backlog; Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and stakeholder communication; Developers implement and test features and participate in design/review; QA validates acceptance criteria and runs manual or automated checks as needed. Communication cadence supports this structure with daily standups for blockers and progress, a weekly delivery sync to show progress and highlight risks, weekly PM–PdM alignment, monthly stakeholder updates, and end-of-sprint demos or reviews for visibility and feedback.

Quality assurance and risk control are embedded in CI and process checks. The guidance calls for unit and integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and security scanning in CI; manual QA is used for feature acceptance when necessary. Pre-release gates require passing CI and security scans, drafted release notes, and a rollback/mitigation plan. Incidents trigger an incident playbook with on-call notification, triage, rollback if needed, and a blameless retrospective to capture action items that feed back into the backlog for continuous improvement.
